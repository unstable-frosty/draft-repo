# 📘 **Development Stages (Engineering Overview)**  

---

## 📝 **1. Planning Phase**
Before building, we established a clear engineering direction to avoid wasted time and redesign loops.

**During this phase, we:**
- Defined the requirements of the WRO Future Engineers category and identified the technical functions our robot needed (accurate look-ahead sensing, smooth steering, stable behavior).
- Explored multiple steering mechanisms—**Ackermann and parallel**—and evaluated their geometric constraints and complexity.
- Sketched chassis concepts prioritizing **compactness, sensor visibility, and wiring accessibility**.
- Mapped out component placement, wheel sizing, motor orientation, and overall spatial constraints.
- Divided roles based on strengths:  
  **Kareem** on design, documentation, and sensory alignment;  
  **Adam** on coding, logic development, and control behavior.
- Built an iterative workflow centered on **prototype → test → document → optimize**.

> This planning stage created a solid foundation for a structured, engineering-focused development cycle.

## 🧭 **Background & Previous Experience**
Before entering the Future Engineers category, we built our foundation through years of self-driven learning and previous WRO participation. We are fully self-taught developers, and although this is our **first year** in Future Engineers, it is our **second year** competing in the WRO overall.

Our previous experience in the **RoboMission** category played a huge role in shaping our engineering mindset. The creative freedom of RoboMission forced us to approach problems with open-ended design thinking, which later became extremely valuable when building our obstacle-avoiding robot. It helped us develop a strong mechanical intuition, especially when designing compact robots under strict constraints.

We also gained experience in **line-following competitions**, where we pushed a LEGO EV3 system to its limits—breaking a **16-year standing record** using a finely tuned mathematical **PD control equation**. These challenges taught us precision, control theory, and efficient algorithm design.

Despite all these skills, the Future Engineers category introduced new obstacles:  
- camera placement and stabilization,  
- field-dependent calibration,  
- and even working with new mathematical concepts like **quadratic curve equations**.

These experiences shaped not only our workflow but also our determination to continuously adapt, learn, and engineer better solutions.

## 💡 **2. Concept Development**
Once the plan was set, we refined our ideas into early mechanical models and layout options.

**Our goals during concept development:**
- Create a chassis with enough turning freedom for tight maneuvers.
- Ensure the ultrasonic had a **clear forward “look-ahead” line**, crucial for fast reaction distance.
- Balance the robot’s size with maneuverability and mechanical simplicity.
- Identify weaknesses early through sketches and mini assemblies before committing to a full build.
- Prepare for multiple prototyping rounds with clear fallback options.

> Concept development gave us clarity on what to expect from each iteration and narrowed down our design path.

# 🛠️ **3. Prototyping Phase**

## 🔧 **Prototype V1 — Initial Exploration**

### **Engineering Characteristics**
- Ackermann steering paired with a differential drivetrain.  
- Medium motors mounted horizontally and stacked.  
- Steering geared down with bevel gears to smooth movements.  
- Spike wheels used for both drive and steering.  
- Ultrasonic sensor positioned **mid-chassis** due to blocked front space.

### **Issues Identified**
- Robot footprint became **too large**, reducing turning radius and limiting steering angle.  
- Large front wheels blocked us from adding ultrasonic sensors in the front.  
- The sensor being in the middle under the chassis created **late reaction time** for .....
- In open challenge tests, the robot frequently overcorrected due to inaccurate distance readings.

### ✅ **Engineering Insight from V1**  
Placing the ultrasonic at the front was essential.  
Ultrasonic sensor position was extremely inefficient and was the root problem of the robot

## 🔧 **Prototype V2 — Structural Redesign**

### **Major Engineering Changes**
- Motors reoriented **vertically**, reducing the width and freeing space.  
- Steering system replaced with simplified **parallel steering** geared from 8 tooth to 16 tooth bevel gear to increase encoder resolution..  
- Smaller wheels added in the front, allowing nearly **100° of steering rotation**.  
- First attempt at **direct steering drive** without gears.

### **Challenges Introduced**
- Direct steering became **too responsive**, causing overshoot, undershoot, and jittering.  
- Micro-movements translated instantly into large steering corrections.  
- Algorithm tuning became extremely sensitive and unstable.

### ✅ **Breakthrough Solution**
- Reintroducing **gear reduction** added a small amount of **mechanical backlash**, which unexpectedly **damped micro-corrections**.  
- This created **smoother, more predictable steering behavior** and simplified algorithm tuning.

### ✅ **Engineering Insight from V2**  
Controlled mechanical imperfections—like backlash—can **stabilize** control loops instead of harming them.

# 📊 **4. Testing & Evaluation**

### **Testing Focus Areas**
- Sensor reaction time after enabling forward look-ahead.  
- Steering stability across different correction frequencies.  
- Influence of wheel sizes and angles on maneuverability.  
- Chassis balance and structural vibration during sharp turns.  
- Repeatability across multiple test runs.

### ✅ **What Testing Revealed**
- Front-mounted ultrasonic dramatically improved reaction timing.  
- Parallel steering with small amount backlash provided the smoothest, most consistent control.  
- Compact front geometry enabled tighter steering without mechanical strain.

# 🔧 **5. Optimization Phase**
After identifying successful configurations, we refined the design for robust performance.

**Key optimizations included:**
- Fine steering tuning around the backlash window for predictable corrections.  
- Improved sensor alignment (camera + ultrasonic) for consistent visibility.  
- Rebalancing weight to reduce drift and uneven turns.  
- Cleaning wiring paths to prevent obstruction and simplify debugging.  
- Simplifying subsystems for easier maintenance and quick adjustments.

# 🚀 **6. Application Phase**
This is where the robot moved from “working prototype” to “competition-ready system.”

**Application achievements:**
- Algorithms were adapted to work *with* mechanical backlash, not against it.  
- Sensor data and steering logic were combined to create stable, early reactions to obstacles.  
- Mechanical behavior and software tuning were synchronized for predictable, repeatable runs.  
- The final robot delivered consistent performance across different field setups and lighting conditions.

# 🤝 **Work Ethic & Team Collaboration**

## **Team Collaboration**
- Tasks were divided logically—coding (Adam), design & documentation (Kareem)—but both of us contributed to each other’s work whenever needed.  
- Working in the same environment allowed rapid testing, immediate feedback, and fast iteration cycles.  
- Difficult problems were solved together by combining hardware and software perspectives.

## **Problem-Solving Approach**
1. Identify the issue  
2. Break it into manageable components  
3. Test a targeted solution  
4. Evaluate results  
5. Iterate until stable  

## **Documentation Practice**
- Detailed notes after each test  
- Photos capturing build stages  
- Logs of mechanical and algorithmic changes  
- Failures documented as carefully as successes  

## **Core Values**
- **Dedication:** long work sessions with constant iteration  
- **Consistency:** daily improvements and disciplined routine
