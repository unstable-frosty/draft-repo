# Introduction
Hello everyone! 
Welcome to our GitHub repository. In this repo, we will be documenting our journey in building our obstacle avoiding car, while also sharing some details about our software, design struggles and how we managed to overcome these challenges. We hope to inspire everyone who reads this documentation and spark an idea for their future solutions. Thank you for your visit, enjoy the ride!

## Team members

Our team is made up of twin brothers **Kareem** and **Adam** with our mum, **Coach Ebtisam**, keeping us organized and moving forward.



> ### Kareem Siblini  
> **Age:** 16  
> **Role:** Design • Documentation • System integration  
>
> I’m mostly responsible for the robot’s design, documentation, and wiring, but my brother and I always jump in to help each other whenever we need it. I’m really passionate about coding and cybersecurity, and I love using that interest to push our robot further. When I’m not working on the robot, you’ll usually find me playing basketball. This is my first year competing internationally in the WRO and my first time in the Future Engineers category, and I’m super excited to be here!

> ### Adam Siblini  
> **Age:** 16  
> **Role:** Coding • Algorithm & logic development  
>
> I’m mostly in charge of the coding and logic development for our robot, but just like Kareem helps me out, I also jump in to support his work whenever needed. I really enjoy math and love using it to build smarter algorithms for our robot. Outside of robotics, I enjoy swimming and staying active. This is my first year competing internationally in the WRO and my first time in the Future Engineers category, and I’m excited to take on the challenge!

> ### Coach Ebtisam Nassif  
> **Role:** Coach • Organization • Budget & components  
>
> I’m the coach of the team and also the mum of these twin brothers. I help keep everything on track: organizing, motivating, and stepping in when things get complicated so we can break problems down and solve them together. I’m also the one managing the budget and ordering the components we need, making sure the boys have what they need to keep building and improving. My role is to support them, keep things balanced, and guide them forward whenever things get overwhelming.

# Briefing

Our robot is an autonomous EV3 based car programmed in CLEV3R and powered by a coordinated multi sensor system. Three ultrasonic sensors connected through a MindSensors multiplexer provide continuous distance data, while a Pixy camera handles traffic sign color recognition, an EV3 color sensor detects checkpoints, and a gyro maintains accurate orientation by tracking the robot’s angle in real time. Together, these sensors give the robot reliable awareness of its surroundings and consistent interpretation of field elements.

The drivetrain uses EV3 medium motors driving a differential gear layout for smooth forward motion, paired with a custom parallel steering mechanism controlled by an EV3 medium motor. After multiple prototype iterations, this setup delivered the most stable turning, strong look ahead behavior, and minimal oscillation. The final design combines refined mechanical tuning with structured CLEV3R logic, resulting in a compact, responsive, and competition ready Future Engineers robot.

# Final Reflection

To sum this all up, we have put a great amount of work and dedication into this project, and despite the challenges that we have faced throughout, we believe that it was very helpful and insightful, as we learned a lot about new algorithms and mechanisms. We would like to thank our Coach (AKA mum). We would like to apologize to our coach for conquering the house with the map and all the Lego pieces :).
